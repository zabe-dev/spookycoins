    title: 'What is SpookyCoins?',
    body: 'SpookyCoins is built for people who like finding crypto projects early. We bring new launches, presales, and active community picks into one place that is easier to scan.',
  },
  {
    title: 'How are rankings calculated?',
    body: 'Rankings are powered by real votes from the community. When a project has an active boost, its vote power increases for the length of that boost, giving it more visibility while it still competes inside the same ranking flow.',
  },
  {
    title: 'How is trending determined?',
    body: 'A coin can trend when crypto investors start paying attention to it quickly. Recent votes and watchlist activity help us spot projects getting fresh attention, without replacing the main vote-based leaderboard.',
  },
  {
    title: 'What are boosted coins?',
    body: 'Boosts are paid visibility upgrades for listed projects. They can help a coin compete harder in rankings for a set time, but they do not lock in a guaranteed spot or hide that the project is boosted.',
  },
  {
    title: 'How do I submit a coin?',
    body: 'Submit your project with the required details, links, logo, and market information. We review submissions first so the listings stay clean, useful, and easier for crypto investors to compare.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Why is market or chart data missing?',
    body: 'Some tokens are too new or not supported by every data source yet. If we cannot verify a chart, DEX, or market feed, we would rather leave it blank than show something broken.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Do I need an account to vote or watch coins?',
    body: 'Yes. Accounts help keep voting fair and let you build a watchlist you can come back to later. You can also share your watchlist with other investors when you want.',
